DESCRIPTION
==================================================

The goal of this project is to classify in silico 
  microbial colonys based on the phenotype of cells
  within the colony. A full summary is provided at 
  summary/summary.pdf (written with R Markdown).

This project has three types of simulations:

1. "Cell-based" budding yeast colony simulations 
     - Written in Fortran
     - In folder production/code/
2. Imaging software
     - Written in OpenGL
     - In folder production/imaging/
3. Machine learning classifers
     - Written in Python
     - In folder ML_python/code

A summary of the findings of this project (written 
  with R Markdown) is provided summary/summary.pdf
